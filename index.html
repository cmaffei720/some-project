    <h1>Gazzelles Are Awesome </h1> 
    <p>Gazelles can run in speeds up to 60 mph and have extremely powerful legs</p> 
    <p>Gazelles are mostly found in deserts, grasslands, and savannas of Africa; but are also found in southwest and central Asia and the Indian subcontinent.</p> 
    <p>Gazelles run in bounded leaps called "pronking" or "stotting," and use their speed to escape from predators</p>
